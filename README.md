A smart energy meter is an electronic device that wirelessly trasnmits information such as consumption of electric energy, voltage levels and current. 
This smart meter can be installed near the meter that supplies power from the mains grid or after the distribution board, indoors or outside the home/office. The speciality of this energy meter can be installed without making any structural changes to your existing electrical supply. The data would be stored in a local database on the computer and can be analysed further.
This project was carried out as a completion of the final year project of the University of Colombo.
